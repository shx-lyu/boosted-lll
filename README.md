# boosted-lll
lattice reduction for communications. The project contains the implementations of LLL, boosted LLL, deep LLL and SR-SIC.

# How to use
run main_IntegerForcing.m.

# Main file description
Comparing the performance of LLL, boosted LLL, deep LLL and SR-SIC. The lattice bases are taken from Integer-Forcing linear receivers.
The performance metrics are: {'Ergodic rate $R_E$/bpcu','Basis length','Shortest Vector','Average reduction time/s'}.
Set the $M$ value to indicate the desired metric.
